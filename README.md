computer-speak
==============

An informal introduction to programming, intended to provide a bit of structure
for a weekly discussion group.


Getting Started
---------------

* Download and install [Racket][Racket download]. See
  [the getting started guide][Racket getting_started] for more information.

* Make sure you can run the front-end, "DrRacket". It should look like the
  picture in [these instructions][DrRacket interface_essentials].

* Try out the exercises for the first discussion -- click on the file called
  `one.md` in the list above.

* If you are interested, read
  [the prologue to _How to Design Programs_][HtDP Prologue].


Getting help
------------

* Ask me, <James Geddes>. 

* Your first port of call online is the [Racket website][].

* You will find [manuals, documentation, and textbooks][Racket documentation],
  including:

	- [How to Design Programs][HtDP], an introductory textbook based around this
      language; and

	- The [Racket guide][], if you already have some experience with programming.
	

Books (for interest)
--------------------

* [How to Design Programs][HtDP] (oneline). A textbook for a course on an
  introduction to programming.

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][SICP] (online). The textbook
  from MIT's (in)famous introduction to computer science course. The book that
  changed my understanding of programming forever.

* [The Little Schemer][]. Slightly odd: there is very little exposition, just
  lots and lots of examples to try out.

* [The Seasoned Schemer][]: More of the above.
