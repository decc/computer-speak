computer-speak
==============

An informal introduction to programming, intended to provide a bit of structure
for a weekly discussion group.

> [Languages like Racket are] worth learning for a different reason — the
> profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That
> experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even
> if you never actually use [the language] itself a lot.

Getting Started
---------------

* Download and install [Racket][Racket download]. See the
  [getting started guide][Racket getting_started] for more information.

* Make sure you can run the front-end, "DrRacket".

* Try out the exercises for the first discussion -- look in `one.md`.

* If you are interested, read
  [the prologue to _How to Design Programs_][HtDP Prologue].


Getting help
------------

* The [Racket website][].

* Huge amounts of [manuals, documentation, and textbooks][Racket documentation],
  including:

    - The [Racket guide][] if you already have some experience with programming.
	
	- [How to Design Programs][HtDP], an introductory textbook.

Books
-----

* [The Little Schemer][]. It's weird.

* [The Seasoned Schemer][]: More of the above. 

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][SICP]. The textbook
  from MIT's (in)famous introduction to computer science course. The book that
  changed my understanding of programming forever.
