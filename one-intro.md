I learned to program twice.

I first learned to program was when I was about 15. I learned `C`, a traditional
language still used today. One explains to the computer exactly what one wants
it to do, one step at a time, using small set of primitive operations which the
computer understands. 

The second time I learned to program was in grad school. I read a book with the
rather peculiar title of *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs*. Or rather I read the first chapter. Three times. On the third time
through my brain rotated ninety degrees and I never looked at programming the
same way again.
