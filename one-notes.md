Notes for discussion 1
======================

To cover: REPL -- values -- expressions -- variables. Values: numeric, string,
boolean (others?). Expressions: arithmetic, functions. 

Things to do beforehand
-----------------------

Download either [R][] and [RStudio][] or [Racket][]. Install it and make sure
you can run it. For `R`, there is a series of videos showing you how to do just
that at the Coursera course [Computing for Data Analysis][compdata]. (You will
need to sign up for the course.)
